"""Read-only vs. read-write scope filter.

Tools are tagged with a `Scope` at registration time. The server's tool
registry consults this when listing or dispatching tools, so:

- External (untrusted) clients see only `READ_ONLY` tools.
- Internal SME agents (clients that present the configured shared token) see
  both `READ_ONLY` and `READ_WRITE`.

The token check is intentionally trivial today — a single shared secret in
the `SMALT_INTERNAL_TOKEN` env var. If unset, all clients are treated as
internal (single-user dev mode). This gets tightened when smalt-mcp grows up:
- Per-agent tokens (e.g., one for the ingest SME, one for retrieve).
- Optional mTLS or OAuth front-ends for hosted deployments.
